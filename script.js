  /* THINGS THAT HAPPEN ON THIS WEBSITE

    when you open the website plain:
        - lizard info is greyed out
        - the lizard illustration just has a "generate lizard" button
        - visual specifications are obscured?
        - save lizard is disabled, but load lizard is not

    when you open the website from a share link (or paste save code):
        - as though you loaded, generated, named, and generated info
        - 'regenerate' option is disabled
    
    when you click "generate lizard":
        1. the lizard design will populate (maybe with an animation)
           ...and...
           the visual specification fields will populate (equivalent to visual representation)
        2. the user will be prompted to give their lizard a name!
        3. the 'generate info' button will appear on the lizard info section

    when you click "generate info"
        1. the lizard gets a birthday, hobbies, and a fun fact
        2. the save code section is enabled
        3. maybe prompt user to share?
